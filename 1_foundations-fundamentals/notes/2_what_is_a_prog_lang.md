Programming languages provide instructions to a computer using their unique syntax (rules) and semantics (meaning).
Different programming languages have different syntax rules, which can be seen in the "Hello, world" program examples using C++, JavaScript, and Python.
There are many programming languages because each has its own strengths and weaknesses, suited for different tasks and environments.
