# Summary

Basic Math Operations: Python uses symbols like + for addition, \* for multiplication, \*\* for exponents, / for division, // for floor division, and % for the remainder.

Handling Large Numbers: Avoid using commas in large numbers as it confuses the Python interpreter.

Floats vs. Integers: Python distinguishes between whole numbers (integers) and numbers with decimal points (floats), which are used for more precise calculations.

These points are essential for understanding how to work with numbers in Python.
