# Summary

Python: Uses if followed by the condition and a colon. The code block is indented.

Java: Uses if with the condition inside parentheses and curly braces to denote the code block. Indentation is customary but not required.

Ruby: No parentheses or colon for the condition. Uses the end keyword to denote the end of the if-else statement.

These differences highlight how understanding the basic structure of conditional statements helps in recognizing them across various programming languages.
