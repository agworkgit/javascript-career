# Summary

Boolean Expressions: These are expressions that evaluate to either true or false. They are fundamental in making decisions in code.

Relational Operators: Operators like == (equality), != (not equal), > (greater than), and < (less than) are used to compare values and return a Boolean result.

Conditional Statements: These statements use Boolean expressions to execute different blocks of code based on whether the condition is true or false.

These points are essential for understanding how to control the flow of your program based on different conditions.
