# Summary

Variable Declaration: Some languages like Java, C#, and C++ require you to define variables and their types before using them, while languages like Python do not.

Type Flexibility: Python allows you to change the type of a variable after it has been set, whereas stricter languages like Java do not.

Naming Rules: Variable names should contain only letters, numbers, and underscores, should not start with a number, and must avoid spaces and reserved keywords.

These points highlight the differences in how variables are handled across various programming languages, which is crucial for understanding their behavior and usage.
