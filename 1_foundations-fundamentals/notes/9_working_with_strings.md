# Summary

Definition of Strings: Strings are sequences of characters used to handle text in programming. They can include letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces.

Quotation Marks: Strings are typically enclosed in quotes. Python allows both single and double quotes, but the choice depends on the content of the string to avoid syntax errors.

Usage in Functions and Variables: Strings can be directly passed to functions or stored in variables for later use.

These points will help you understand how to effectively work with text in your programs.
