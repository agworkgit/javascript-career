# Summary

Variables: Variables are containers for storing data values. They are assigned a value using the assignment operator (equals sign).

Data Types: Different types of data (e.g., integers, strings) are stored in variables. The type of data determines how much memory is allocated and how the data can be used.

Assignment: Assigning a value to a variable involves placing the value on the right side of the equals sign and the variable name on the left.

These concepts are fundamental as you continue learning programming and will be useful in your journey towards becoming a web developer.
