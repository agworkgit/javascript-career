# Summary

If Statements: An if statement checks a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is true. The structure includes the keyword if, a condition, a colon, and an indented block of code.

Indentation: Proper indentation is crucial in Python to define the block of code that belongs to the if statement. Incorrect indentation will result in errors.

Boolean Expressions: These expressions evaluate to either true or false and are used in if statements to control the flow of the program.

These points will help you understand how to make decisions in your code using conditional statements.
