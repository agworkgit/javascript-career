# Summary

Readability: Adding extra empty lines, or whitespace, makes code easier to read and understand, similar to paragraphs in a book.

Whitespace in Statements: Adding spaces within statements (e.g., around operators) improves readability.

Whitespace Rules: While Python is generally flexible with whitespace, it requires specific spacing for certain keywords (e.g., if statements) to avoid syntax errors.

These points emphasize the importance of using whitespace effectively to enhance the readability and functionality of your code.
