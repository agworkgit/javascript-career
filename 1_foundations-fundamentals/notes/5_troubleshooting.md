# Summary

Types of Errors: There are three main types of errors in programming: syntax errors (breaking language rules), runtime errors (issues during code execution), and semantic errors (unexpected output).

Troubleshooting Syntax Errors: Review each line of code slowly to identify missing quotes, parentheses, or colons.

Troubleshooting Runtime Errors: Look up error messages on resources like Stack Overflow to find solutions.

Troubleshooting Semantic Errors: Make small changes and test your code frequently to identify where the error was introduced. Taking breaks can also help clear your mind.

These points will help you effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues in your code as you continue learning programming.
