# Summary

-   **Organizing Code:** Modules help organize large and complex applications by splitting code into separate files, making it easier to manage and reuse.

-   **Importing Modules:** You can import a module in Python using the import statement, which allows you to reference and use functions from that module in your main code.

-   **Using Functions from Modules:** To use a function from an imported module, reference the module name followed by a period and the function name, for example `module_name.function_name()`.
