# Summary

Creating a List: In Python, you can create a list by specifying a variable name and enclosing the values in square brackets, separated by commas.

Using Comments: Comments in Python start with a hash symbol (#) and are useful for keeping notes in your code without affecting its execution.

Organizing Data: By grouping related variables into a list, you can organize your code better and make it clear that the values are related. This also helps in managing and accessing the data more efficiently.
