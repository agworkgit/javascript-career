# Summary

-   **While Loops:** Use a while loop in Python to continue executing code until a specific condition is met.

-   **Variable Initialization:** Start with a variable that will be modified in each iteration of the loop.

-   **End Condition:** Specify the condition that will end the loop. The loop will continue as long as this condition is true.

-   **Incrementing:** Modify the variable within the loop to eventually meet the end condition, preventing an infinite loop.
