# Summary

-   **Regular Expressions (Regex):** A `regex` is a description of a pattern you want to match in a string, using letters, numbers, and special characters.

-   **Common Patterns:** Special characters like `\d` for digits, `\w` for word characters, and `.` for any character help define patterns. Quantifiers like `+`, `\*`, and `?` specify occurrences.

-   **Practical Use:** You can use Python's `re` module to create and work with regex, such as searching for patterns in strings and manipulating the results.
