# Summary

-   **Classes as Blueprints:** Classes act like cookie cutters, defining the basic properties and methods that objects created from the class will share.

-   **Creating Objects:** You can create multiple objects from a class, each with unique data but sharing the same structure and behavior.

-   **Methods and Customization:** Objects can have methods (functions) that operate on their data, and you can customize each object as needed, like decorating cookies cut from the same cutter.
