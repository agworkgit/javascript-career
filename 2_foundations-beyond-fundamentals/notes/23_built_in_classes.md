# Summary

-   **Built-in Classes:** Python uses built-in classes for basic data types like lists and strings, which come with predefined methods such as count and pop for lists.

-   **Inheritance of Methods:** When you create a list or string, it inherits methods from its respective built-in class, allowing you to perform various actions without additional coding.

-   **Efficiency and Organization:** This object-oriented approach ensures that data objects only have the methods they need, optimizing memory usage and making it easier to work with data.
