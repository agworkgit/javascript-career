# Summary

-   **Types of Bugs:** There are three main types of bugs: syntax errors (code that doesn't follow language rules), runtime errors (code that fails during execution), and logic errors (code that runs but produces incorrect results).

-   **Debugging Process:** Debugging involves identifying and fixing these bugs methodically, often using tools that provide feedback and suggest fixes.

-   **Approach:** Treat debugging as an opportunity to learn more about programming and the specific language you are working with, rather than seeing it as a chore.

# Error Types

-   **Syntax Errors:** These occur when the code doesn't follow the rules of the programming language, such as missing punctuation or misspelled keywords.

    ```
    python example

    if (x > 10 # Missing closing parenthesis
    print("x is greater than 10")
    ```

-   **Runtime Errors:** These happen when the code is syntactically correct but fails during execution, like calling an undefined function.

    ```
    python example

    def greet():
    print("Hello, world!")

    greet_user() # Function greet_user is not defined
    ```

-   **Logic Errors:** These occur when the code runs but produces incorrect results, such as an infinite loop or incorrect calculations.

    ```
    python example

    def greet():
    print("Hello, world!")

    greet_user() # Function greet_user is not defined
    ```
