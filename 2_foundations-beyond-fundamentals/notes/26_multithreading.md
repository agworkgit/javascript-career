# Summary

-   **Multithreading:** This technique allows a program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously by executing separate tasks known as threads concurrently.

-   **Performance Balance:** While multithreading can make programs faster and more responsive, it requires careful management of processing power and memory to avoid slowing down the entire system.

-   **Language Support:** Many programming languages, including Python, support multithreading. Asynchronous code in languages like JavaScript is similar but not identical to multithreading.
