# Summary

-   **Lists and Indexes:** Lists allow you to store related data using a single variable name. Each item in a list is assigned an index number starting from zero, which you use to reference the items.

-   **Dictionaries and Labels:** Dictionaries store data with labels instead of index numbers. You reference dictionary items by their labels, which provides more flexibility and clarity.

-   **Accessing Data:** You can access and manipulate individual pieces of data in both lists and dictionaries using the appropriate syntax, making it easier to work with collections of data in your code.
