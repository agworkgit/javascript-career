# Summary

-   **Concept of Iteration:** Iteration involves repeating a specific task multiple times until a specified endpoint is reached, similar to folding laundry repeatedly until the stack is empty.

-   **Components of Iteration:** To write iterative code, you need to specify the data to iterate through, describe the action to perform on each item, and indicate when the loop should stop.

-   **Infinite Loops:** An infinite loop occurs when the ending condition is omitted or incorrect, causing the loop to never stop, which can lead to a program freezing or overloading the computer.
