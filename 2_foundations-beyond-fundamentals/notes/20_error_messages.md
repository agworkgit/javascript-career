# Summary

-   **Clues, Not Solutions:** Error messages provide clues about where and what type of issue occurred, but they often require further investigation to pinpoint the exact problem.

-   **Two-Line Layout:** Interpreters commonly use a two-line layout with a carat symbol pointing to the character where the problem was detected, helping you locate the issue.

-   **Iterative Debugging:** Fixing one error may reveal another, so it's important to run your code frequently and address each issue as it appears.

# Debugging without error messages

-   **No Error Indicators:** Sometimes, code can have errors without any visible error messages or squiggles in the editor, making it harder to identify issues.

-   **Logical Thinking:** Debugging without error messages requires you to think through your code logically from the computer's perspective to identify where the instructions differ from your intentions.

-   **Common Mistakes:** Recognizing common mistakes you tend to make, such as mixing up comparison operators, can help you debug more efficiently.
