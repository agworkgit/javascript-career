# Summary

-   **Planning Phase:** Pseudocoding is a planning step where you outline what your program needs to do using plain language, helping you map out the program's structure.

-   **Flexibility:** It allows you to describe the program's tasks without worrying about specific syntax or programming languages.

-   **Avoiding Pitfalls:** Writing pseudocode helps prevent missing tasks or behaviors in your code, ensuring a more organized and thought-out approach before actual coding begins.
