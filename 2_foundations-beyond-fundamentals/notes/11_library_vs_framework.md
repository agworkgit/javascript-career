# Summary

-   **Libraries vs. Frameworks:** Libraries provide a set of tools that you can use as you wish, while frameworks define how you should accomplish a task, offering a more structured approach.

-   **Examples in Python:** Popular Python libraries include TensorFlow and Pandas for machine learning, and NumPy and SciPy for mathematical manipulations. Widely used frameworks include Django and Flask for web content management.

-   **Usage Considerations:** When starting out, you may not need libraries or frameworks immediately, but as you take on larger projects, they can save time and help manage complexity.
