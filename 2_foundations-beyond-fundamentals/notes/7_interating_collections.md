# Summary

-   **For Loops in Python:** You can create a loop using the for keyword to iterate through a list. The loop will automatically end after the last item in the list.

-   **Indentation Matters:** Proper indentation is crucial in Python. Statements inside the loop must be indented, while statements outside the loop should not be, to ensure they execute at the correct time.

-   **Avoiding Repetition:** Using loops allows you to work with sets of data without writing repetitive code, making your programs more efficient and easier to manage.
