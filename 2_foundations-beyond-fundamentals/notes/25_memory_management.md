# Summary

-   **Memory Management:** Some programming languages allow programmers to manually manage memory, deciding what to keep and what to discard, which can be complex and prone to errors like memory leaks.

-   **Garbage Collection:** Many modern languages, such as Python, JavaScript, and Ruby, use garbage collection to automatically manage memory, freeing up space by deleting items no longer needed.

-   **Performance Considerations:** Manual memory management can be beneficial for high-performance applications, such as video games, where precise control over memory is crucial.
