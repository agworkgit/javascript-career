# Summary

-   **Dictionaries in Python:** A dictionary allows you to store related information with labels for each item, using curly braces `{}` and separating key-value pairs with colons `:`.

-   **Creating a Dictionary:** You can create a dictionary by specifying a variable name and enclosing the key-value pairs in curly braces. Each key is followed by a colon and its corresponding value, separated by commas.

-   **Organizing Data:** Using dictionaries helps retain more information about each item, providing flexibility in how you work with the data, unlike lists which only group items without labels.
