# Summary

-   **Variability Across Languages:** Collections like lists and dictionaries vary significantly across programming languages. For example, Python allows mixed data types in lists, while languages like C++ require uniform data types.

-   **Mutability:** Some collections are mutable (can be changed), like Python lists and dictionaries, while others are immutable (cannot be changed after creation), like Python `tuples`.

-   **Naming Differences:** Common collections have different names in various languages. For instance, a `list` in Python is called an `array` in JavaScript and C++, and Python `dictionaries` are known as associative arrays, maps, object literals or tables in other languages.
