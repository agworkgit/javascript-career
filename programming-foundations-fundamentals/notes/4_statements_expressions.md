# Summary

Statements: These are the building blocks of any program, representing individual actions the program needs to perform.

Operators and Expressions: Operators (like +, -, \*, /) are symbols that perform actions on inputs (operands). Expressions combine operators and operands to produce a single value.

Order of Operations: The order in which operations are performed follows mathematical rules (PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction).

These concepts are fundamental in programming and will help you as you continue your journey into web development.
