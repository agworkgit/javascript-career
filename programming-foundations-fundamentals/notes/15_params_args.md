# Summary

Parameters and Arguments: Parameters are variables listed inside the parentheses in the function definition. Arguments are the values passed to the function when it is called.

Function Behavior: Functions can change their behavior based on the input provided through arguments, allowing for more dynamic and flexible code.

Example: The video uses a car wash function to illustrate how different arguments (e.g., amount paid) can result in different outputs (e.g., basic or platinum car wash).

These points help you understand how to use parameters and arguments to make your functions more versatile.
